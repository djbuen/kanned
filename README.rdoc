== Overview

This is a Kannel VAS gateway that receives SMS messages from a Kannel SMSbox and stores it to a rabbit-mq server. Also listens for new messages to send via rabbit-mq and sends it back to the Kannel SMSbox instance.

== Status

Super, duper in development. Not useable at all. I don't even know why you're even reading this.

== TODO

* Parse config/kanned.yml
* Rack middleware to handle gateways defined in config/kanned.yml
* Mapping of gateways to classes
